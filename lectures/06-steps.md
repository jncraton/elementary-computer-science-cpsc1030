---

K-2.PA.2: Using age-appropriate vocabulary, explain steps taken and choices made to improve the design of a sequence.

## The Big Idea

- We're exploring how to teach children to plan
- This is a core part of computational thinking
- It's also a fundamental life skill

## Deconstructing a Goal

- A goal is the final outcome we want to achieve
- Planning is about figuring out how to get there
- We can help children break down a big goal into smaller steps

## Stating the Goal

- The first step is to state the goal clearly
- Use clear and simple language

What is an example of a simple goal a kindergarten student might have that requires a few steps to achieve?

## Sub-Goals

- A big goal can be broken into smaller sub-goals
- For a sandwich, sub-goals could be 'get the bread' or 'add the cheese'
- This makes the task feel more manageable

## The Right Order

- The order of steps matters
- You can't add cheese before you get the bread
- Children need to understand the sequence of events

## Exercise

Think of a simple classroom task, like cleaning up. What are the individual steps involved, and in what order do they need to be done?
