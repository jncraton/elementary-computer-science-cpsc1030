# Planning Sequences

---

K-2.PA.1: Breakdown and plan the order of the steps needed for a desired outcome to accomplish the goal.

---

K-2.PA.2: Using age-appropriate vocabulary, explain steps taken and choices made to improve the design of a sequence.

## The Big Idea

- We're exploring how to teach children to plan
- This is a core part of computational thinking
- It's also a fundamental life skill

## Deconstructing a Goal

- A goal is the final outcome we want to achieve
- Planning is about figuring out how to get there
- We can help children break down a big goal into smaller steps

## Stating the Goal

- The first step is to state the goal clearly
- Use clear and simple language

What is an example of a simple goal a kindergarten student might have that requires a few steps to achieve?

## Sub-Goals

- A big goal can be broken into smaller sub-goals
- For a sandwich, sub-goals could be 'get the bread' or 'add the cheese'
- This makes the task feel more manageable

## The Right Order

- The order of steps matters
- You can't add cheese before you get the bread
- Children need to understand the sequence of events

## Exercise

Think of a simple classroom task, like cleaning up. What are the individual steps involved, and in what order do they need to be done?

## Beyond the Sequence

- Planning isn't just about a list of steps
- It's also about making choices along the way
- These choices improve the outcome

## What Went Wrong?

- Sometimes the plan doesn't work out
- This is a learning opportunity, not a failure
- We can help children analyze what happened

## A Better Plan

- Talk about what could be changed to improve the plan
- Maybe they need more ingredients or different tools
- This is where the iterative process comes in

What are some age-appropriate words we can use to help children talk about improving their plans?

## The Importance of Words

- Using the right vocabulary is key
- Words like 'sequence,' 'step,' and 'improve'
- Children should be able to explain their thinking

## Explaining Decisions

- Encourage children to explain their choices
- Why did they choose that ingredient or tool?
- This builds their metacognitive skills

## Exercise

Work with a partner. Plan how to tie a shoe and then explain the steps you chose and why you chose them to another pair of students.

How can we help children understand that "failing" at a task is an important part of the learning process?

## Final Step: Review

- After the task is complete, review the process
- Did the plan work as expected?
- What could be done differently next time?
