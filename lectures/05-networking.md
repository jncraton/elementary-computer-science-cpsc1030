Password Cracking
-----------------

- Software can automate the process of password cracking
- May be able to try billions of passwords per second
- Common or reused passwords will be easily guessed

Password Policies
-----------------

- You will be required to follow password policies of your organization
- Select passwords that are uncommon and difficult to guess

Second Factor
-------------

- Many organizations will require two-factor authentication
- You may need a code or app from your phone to login
- This protects systems when passwords are stolen

Exercise
--------

Which password would you expect to be the strongest?

    A. password
    B. 123456
    C. AndersonUniversity1!
    D. HSrH@2jz
    E. TypeRentMultiplicationFierce
