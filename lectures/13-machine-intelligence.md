# Human vs Machine

---

3-5.CD.4: Describe what distinguishes humans from machines, focusing on human intelligence versus machine intelligence.

## Human Intelligence

- Humans can think, reason, and learn
- We solve new problems creatively
- We adapt to complex situations

## Machine Intelligence

- Machines follow instructions, or algorithms
- They process vast amounts of data quickly
- They excel at tasks they are trained for

## Humans

- Humans are distinguished by deep, general intelligence
- We learn across many different domains
- We apply knowledge flexibly

## Machines

- Machines are often distinguished by narrow intelligence
- They are typically designed for one specific task
- Their abilities are limited by their training data

## Exercise

Think of an example of human task that a machine would struggle with. Why do you think the machine struggles?

## Artificial Intelligence

- AI involves getting a computer to perform a task that would require intelligence if performed by a human
- It focuses on making computers mimic human cognition
- Machine learning is a method used for AI

## LLM Origins

- Large Language Models are a type of AI
- They are trained on huge amounts of text data
- They learn patterns in language

## Key Moments

- Early 2010s saw growth in deep learning
- AlexNet (2012) showed the power of deep neural nets for image recognition
- This paved the way for larger models

## Transformers Emerge

- The "Attention Is All You Need" paper (2017)
- Introduced the Transformer architecture
- This structure improved language processing

## LLM Development

- Early LLMs were large but less conversational
- GPT-2 (2019) showed impressive text generation
- It could write coherent, long passages

## ChatGPT Arrival

- ChatGPT (2022) made LLMs widely accessible
- It demonstrated interactive, conversational ability
- It uses a refined Transformer model

If a machine can generate a story, does that mean it's creative? Why or why not?

## How LLMs Work

- They predict the next most likely word
- They do this based on the words before it
- They are essentially advanced pattern matchers

## Limitations

- LLMs lack real world experience
- They don't truly "understand" meaning
- They can generate false or nonsensical information

## Human Knowledge

- Humans build understanding through interaction
- We connect language to sensory experience
- Our knowledge is grounded in reality

## Machine Knowledge

- LLMs' "knowledge" is statistical association
- They learn relationships between words
- Their world is only the text they read

How is the way an LLM learns a language different from the way a child learns a language?

## Exercise

Write a two-sentence instruction for a child that highlights a key difference between human and machine thinking.

## General vs Narrow

- Humans have general-purpose minds
- We are flexible problem-solvers
- Machines have specific, narrow functions

---

## Exercise

Describe a simple task that a five-year-old child can do but that a current-day LLM cannot, and explain the underlying reason.
