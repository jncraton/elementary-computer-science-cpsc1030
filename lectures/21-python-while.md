Iteration
=========

Assignment
----------

- Variables can be assigned values

```python
x = 1
y = 1 + 2
```

Updating Variables
------------------

- Sometimes we want to update the values in variables
- We can set variables to expressions that include those variables

```python
x = x + 1
```

Increment and Decrement
-----------------------

- Increment is increase by 1
- Decrement is decrease by 1

```python
x = x + 1 # Increment
x = x - 1 # Decrement
```

Augmented Assignment
--------------------

We can shorten common reassignment using [augmented assignment](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements):


```python
x += 1 # Increment
x -= 1 # Decrement
```

while
-----

- Repetition in programs is a common task
- We introduce `while` to perform operations multiple times

Example
-------

```python
while True:
    answer = input("What is the capital of France?")
    
    if answer == "Paris":
        print("That's correct!")
        exit()
    else:
        print("Not quite. Try again.")
```

Indefinite iteration
--------------------

- We do not specify how many times a `while` loop will execute in advance
- This makes iteration indefinite

Controlling Iteration
---------------------

- `while` accepts a conditional that will stop iteration when false
- This can be used to control how many times we iterate

Counting
--------

```python
i = 0

while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Infinite Loop
-------------

- We must be careful to avoid looping forever
- A loop that never stops is called an infinite loop
- This is a common type of bug

Infinite Loop
-------------

```python
i = 0

while True:
    print(i)
```

break
-----

- `break` can be used to terminate iteration
- Control moves to after the loop body

Example
-------

```python
i = 0

while True:
    if i > 10:
        break
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```

continue
--------

- `continue` can be reused to skip the remainder of an iteration
- Control will return to the conditional on the while statement

Example
-------

```python
while True:
    num = input("Enter a number:")
    
    try:
        square = int(num) ** 2
    except:
        print("Invalid number")
        continue
    
    print(square)
```
