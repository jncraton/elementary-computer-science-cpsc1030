# Troubleshooting

## Objective

K-2.CD.2: Describe and troubleshoot basic hardware and software problems using appropriate terminology.

K-2.CD.3: Select and operate appropriate software to perform a variety of tasks and recognize that users have different needs and preferences for the technology they use.

## Troubleshooting Technology

- This is the process of solving technical issues
- We apply a logical approach to find the cause

## Problem Identification

- The first step is to identify the problem
- What is not working?
- For example, "The sound isn't working on the tablet"

## Hypothesize Cause

- Why might it not be working?
- For example, "Maybe the volume is turned down"

## Attempt Solution

- Test your hypothesis
- For example, you can check the volume controls
- This is a form of trial and error

## Repeat

- If the first guess doesn't work, make a new guess
- You continue this process until you find the solution
- This is a systematic approach to solving problems

## Terminology Matters

- We should use precise words
- This helps us communicate clearly
- Using the right terms makes problem solving easier

## Exercise

Think about a common classroom problem, like a device not turning on. What are things you would tell a student to check?

## Describing Problems

- Encourage students to use specific language
- Instead of "it's broken," they can say "the mouse won't move"
- This helps you understand what's wrong

## Using the Right Words

- Teach students terms like "keyboard" or "monitor"
- This empowers them to communicate more effectively

## A Teaching Moment

- When a problem arises, turn it into a lesson
- Ask students to help you troubleshoot
- This makes them active participants in their learning

## Troubleshooting Together

- This teaches collaboration and critical thinking
- It builds confidence in their ability to solve problems
- It shows them that it's okay for things to not work sometimes

How can teaching children about troubleshooting help them beyond computer science?

## Selecting Software

- We use different software for different tasks

## Recognizing Needs

- People use technology for different reasons
- A video editor has different needs than a writer
- Different software serves different purposes

## What's the Goal?

- What do we want to accomplish?
- Do we want to write a story or draw a picture?

## Different Users

- Software is built with an audience in mind
- A drawing tool for use in K-5 will have different features than graphic design tools used by professionals

Why is it important for children to understand that different people have different technology needs?

## Knowing Your Tools

- Once we know the goal, we can select the right tool
- For writing, a word processor is a good choice
- For drawing, a paint program is better
