# Troubleshooting

## Objective

K-2.CD.2: Describe and troubleshoot basic hardware and software problems using appropriate terminology.

## What are Problems?

- Sometimes technology doesn't work as expected
- Problems can be big or small
- For example, a program might not open or the sound might not work

## Troubleshooting Technology

- This is the process of solving problems
- We use a logical approach to find the cause

## Problem Identification

- The first step is to identify the problem
- What is not working?
- For example, "The sound isn't working on the tablet"

## Hypothesize Cause

- Why might it not be working?
- For example, "Maybe the volume is turned down"

## Attempt Solution

- Test your hypothesis
- For example, you can check the volume controls
- This is a form of trial and error

## Repeat

- If the first guess doesn't work, make a new guess
- You continue this process until you find the solution
- This is a systematic approach to solving problems

## Terminology Matters

- We should use precise words
- This helps us communicate clearly
- Using the right terms makes problem solving easier

## Exercise

Think about a common classroom problem, like a device not turning on. What are three things you would tell a student to check?

## Describing Problems

- Encourage students to use specific language
- Instead of "it's broken," they can say "the mouse won't move"
- This helps you understand what's wrong

## Using the Right Words

- Teach students terms like "keyboard" or "monitor"
- This empowers them to communicate more effectively

## Exercise

Give an example of a simple hardware or software problem a child might encounter and explain how you would guide them to troubleshoot it. Use appropriate terminology.

## A Teaching Moment

- When a problem arises, turn it into a lesson
- Ask students to help you troubleshoot
- This makes them active participants in their learning

## Troubleshooting Together

- This teaches collaboration and critical thinking
- It builds confidence in their ability to solve problems
- It shows them that it's okay for things to not work sometimes

How can teaching children about troubleshooting help them beyond computer science?

## Final Exercise

Imagine a student tells you that the "app won't open." What three questions would you ask them to help them solve the problem?
