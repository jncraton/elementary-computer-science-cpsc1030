# Data Modeling and Visualization

---

K-2.DI.2: Define stored information as data and when appropriate, copy, search, retrieve, modify, and delete it

---

K-2.DI.3: Model that data can be stored and manipulated using numbers or symbols to represent information.

---

K-2.DI.4: Organize and present data in different visual formats such as charts, graphs, and symbols, and identify and describe patterns to make predictions. (E)

## What is Data?

- Any piece of stored information
- It can be a number, a word, or a picture

## Data is Everywhere

- The number of students in a class
- The letters in your name
- Your class's favorite colors

## Representing Information

We can represent data using symbols to create a model.

- A number `5` can represent five votes
- A üëç can represent a 'yes' vote

## Digital Storage

Google Sheets is a tool for storing and organizing data in a digital grid.

## Exercise

Create a new Google Sheet. Label column A "Pet" and column B "Count". Enter total counts for each pet owned in the classroom.

## References

- Row and columns can be referenced within formulas
- References may be relative or absolute (`$`)

How might organizing data in a grid help a young student understand information better than just seeing it in a paragraph?

## Data for Kids

How can we adapt this for K-2 students?

- Using pictures or emojis instead of words
- Using simple, relatable datasets like favorite foods
- Focusing on the physical actions of changing the data

## Unplugged First

Before using a computer, model these ideas with physical objects.

- Using sticky notes on a whiteboard
- Moving them around to copy, modify, and delete

## Visualizing Data Basics

- It makes data easier to understand quickly
- Young students need simple, clear visuals

## Types of Visuals

- Tally marks are an early, simple visual
- Bar charts use rectangles to compare groups

## Bar Charts

- Bar charts are excellent for comparing totals
- They have two axes: categories and values
- The length of the bar shows the amount

## Organizing Data Effectively

- Data can be sorted before being presented
- Sorting makes the visual format much clearer
- Start with sorting by size or count

## Presenting Data

- Google Sheets makes it easy to create visuals
- Students can quickly move from data to a chart

## From Table to Chart

- Highlight the organized data in the sheet
- Use the 'Insert' menu and select 'Chart'
- Sheets automatically suggests visual formats

## Describing Patterns

- Once data is visual, students describe what they see
- "Blue has the most" or "Red and Green are the same"
- This links the visual to an observation

## Making Predictions

- Use the identified patterns to guess what might happen next
- Predictions encourage critical thinking

What are the ethical implications of presenting data visually, even in a simple K-2 context?

## Final Check

- Does the visual match the original data?
- Is the visual easy for another child to read?
