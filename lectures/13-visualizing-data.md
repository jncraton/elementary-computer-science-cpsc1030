# Visualizing Data

K-2.DI.4: Organize and present data in different
visual formats such as charts, graphs, and
symbols, and identify and describe patterns to
make predictions. (E)

What makes a visual representation of data effective for a first-grade student?

## Visualizing Data Basics

- It makes data easier to understand quickly
- Young students need simple, clear visuals

## Types of Visuals

- **Tally marks** are an early, simple visual
- **Bar charts** use rectangles to compare groups
- **Pictographs** use symbols or pictures for data

## Bar Charts

- Bar charts are excellent for comparing totals
- They have two axes: categories and values
- The length of the bar shows the amount

## Pictographs in Class

- Each picture or symbol represents one or more items
- They are very engaging and concrete for children
- Make sure students understand the **key** or scale

## Exercise

Design a simple pictograph data collection activity based on your favorite color. What symbol would you use for the pictograph?

## Symbols for Data

- Simple shapes like stars, hearts, or circles can be used
- These symbols are good for basic sorting and counting
- Students can also use **emojis** as data symbols

## Organizing Data Effectively

- Data can be **sorted** before being presented
- Sorting makes the visual format much clearer
- Start with sorting by size or count

## Presenting Data

- Google Sheets makes it easy to create visuals
- Students can quickly move from data to a chart
- Focus on making the visual **accurate**

How can using Google Sheets with young children help demystify the process of data visualization?

## From Table to Chart

- Highlight the organized data in the sheet
- Use the 'Insert' menu and select 'Chart'
- Sheets automatically suggests visual formats

## Chart Format Choice

- For K-2, stick to **Bar Charts** or **Pie Charts**
- Avoid complex types like scatter plots
- The goal is simple, direct comparison

## Describing Patterns

- Once data is visual, students describe what they see
- "Blue has the most" or "Red and Green are the same"
- This links the visual to an **observation**

## Identifying Patterns

- Patterns are repeatable or predictable sequences
- They can be in the **colors** used in the chart
- They can also be in the **heights** of the bars

## Making Predictions

- Use the identified patterns to guess what might happen next
- "If we ask more people, I predict blue will still be highest"
- Predictions encourage **critical thinking**

## Prediction Example

- If we see a pattern of 'small, medium, large, small, medium, large'
- We predict the next item will be **large**
- This applies directly to sequences in data

What are the ethical implications of presenting data visually, even in a simple K-2 context?

## Using Sheets to Predict

- Sheets doesn't "predict" the future for them
- It helps students **organize** data for their own prediction
- The visual provides evidence for their educated guess

## Exercise

Look at a simple bar chart showing the number of sunny days this week. Based on the pattern you see, what is your prediction for tomorrow?

## Final Check

- Does the visual match the original data?
- Is the visual easy for another child to read?
- Can a pattern be clearly described?

## Exercise

Write a sentence describing a pattern you see in a sample bar chart showing pet ownership.
