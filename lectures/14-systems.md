# Computer Systems

---

Learning Outcome: Students identify
similarities between computing systems to
troubleshoot common problems and choose
appropriate combinations of hardware and
software to accomplish desired tasks.

---

3-5.CD.1: Model how computer hardware and
software work together to accomplish tasks.

---

3-5.CD.2: Determine potential solutions to solve
simple hardware and software problems using
common troubleshooting strategies. (E)

---

3-5.CD.3: Describe how internal and external
parts of computing devices function to form a
system.

## Hardware and Software

- A computer is a system
- It needs two main parts to work:
    - Hardware
    - Software

## What is Hardware?

- The physical parts of a computer
- You can touch them
- Examples: keyboard, monitor, mouse, hard drive

## What is Software?

- The instructions that tell the hardware what to do
- Programs and applications
- You can't touch it
- Examples: a web browser, a video game, an operating system

If a recipe is software, what is hardware?

## Working Together

- Hardware is useless without software
- Software needs hardware to run the instructions
- They must work together to complete a task

## System Example

- To write an email:
- You use the **keyboard** (hardware)
- The **email application** (software) processes the letters
- The **monitor** (hardware) shows you the text

## Internal Parts

- Some hardware is inside the device
- These are often called internal parts
- Examples: CPU, memory (RAM), motherboard

## External Parts

- Some hardware is outside the device
- These are often called external parts
- Examples: monitor, mouse, printer, external drive

## Forming a System

- All internal and external parts have a function
- They are connected and work together
- Each part plays a critical role in the whole system

## Why Systems Fail

- Sometimes a computer doesn't work properly
- This is often a problem with either hardware or software
- We need to figure out which one is causing the issue

## Troubleshooting Strategy

- A basic strategy is to check the simplest things first
- Did I plug it in?
- Is the volume turned up?
- Is the program fully loaded?

## Hardware Check

- If the screen is blank:
    - Check if the power cord is connected
    - Check if the monitor is turned on
    - Check if the computer itself is on

## Software Check

- If an application stops responding:
    - Try closing and reopening the application
    - Try restarting the entire computer

## Potential Solutions

- Problem: The mouse won't move the cursor
- Solution 1: Check if the mouse is plugged in
- Solution 2: Try a different USB port
- Solution 3: Check the mouse settings in the software

## Choosing the Right Tool

- We choose hardware and software based on the task
- For typing a report, you need a word processor (software) and a keyboard (hardware)

## Task and Tools

- For editing a photo:
    - You need photo editing software
    - You may need a fast processor (hardware)
    - You may need lots of memory (hardware)

## Tool Combinations

- The combination of hardware and software matters
- Some software needs specific, powerful hardware
- Choosing the right combination makes the task easier

If a task requires quick calculations, what hardware component is most important?
