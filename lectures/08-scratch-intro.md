# Introduction to Scratch


## The Scratch Interface

- The stage is where our creations come to life
- The sprite pane shows us all the characters we can control
- We can add new characters from the library

## Exercise

- Open Scratch and choose a new sprite from the library.

## Scratch Blocks

- Blocks are the building blocks of our programs
- We arrange them like puzzle pieces
- Each block has a specific job or action

---

What kind of actions might you want a character in a story to do?

## Motion Blocks

- Motion blocks make our sprites move
- They can go forward, turn, or even jump to a new spot
- These blocks are all blue

## Looks Blocks

- Looks blocks change how our sprites appear
- We can make them say something or change their size
- These blocks are all purple

## Sound Blocks

- Sound blocks add noise to our projects
- We can play a sound or a specific musical note
- These blocks are all magenta

## Event Blocks

- Event blocks are the starting points for our code
- They tell our program when to begin
- A common one is the green flag

## Putting It Together

- We drag blocks from the palette to the code area
- The code area is where we arrange our blocks
- We connect them from top to bottom

## Sprite Movement

- We use motion blocks to create movement
- A sequence of these blocks makes the sprite follow a path
- Each block is a single instruction

## Our First Program

- Let's make a sprite move and say hello
- We'll use blocks from the motion and looks categories
- Remember to start with an event block

## Exercise

Create a sequence of blocks that makes a sprite say "Hello!" and then move 50 steps.

## Fixing Problems

- Programs don't always work perfectly the first time
- We have to look for and fix errors
- This process is called debugging

## Debugging Practice

- If our sprite doesn't move, we check our blocks
- Is the "move" block connected to an event block?
- Is the number of steps correct?

## Simple Sequences

- A sequence is a series of instructions
- We put blocks together in a specific order
- The computer follows them one by one

## Order Matters

- The order of our blocks is very important
- If we change the order, the program's behavior changes
- Think of it like steps in a recipe

## Planning a Program

- Before we code, we should think about our goal
- What do we want our program to do?
- We can write down the steps first

## Exercise

Write a simple list of steps to make a sprite move in a square.
