# Midterm Topics

## Data & Information (DI)

Learning Outcome: Students collect, store, visualize, and transform data to make inferences and predictions about the world. 

-----

K-2.DI.1: Identify and collect data using digital tools (e.g., take pictures of all blue items, create a document with things that start with "a"). 

-----

K-2.DI.2: Define stored information as data and when appropriate, copy, search, retrieve, modify, and delete it. 

-----

K-2.DI.3: Model that data can be stored and manipulated using numbers or symbols to represent information. 

-----

K-2.DI.4: Organize and present data in different visual formats such as charts, graphs, and symbols, and identify and describe patterns to make predictions. (E). 

## Computing Devices & Systems (CD)

Learning Outcome: Students identify a computing system as being composed of hardware and software, troubleshooting common problems and generating solutions based on the needs of the user. 

-----

K-2.CD.1: Use appropriate terminology in identifying and describing computer hardware. (E). 

-----

K-2.CD.2: Describe and troubleshoot basic hardware and software problems using appropriate terminology. 

-----

K-2.CD.3: Select and operate appropriate software to perform a variety of tasks and recognize that users have different needs and preferences for the technology they use. 

## Programs & Algorithms (PA)

Learning Outcome: Students model complex tasks using algorithmic problem solving and develop simple computing programs to represent them. 

-----

K-2.PA.1: Breakdown and plan the order of the steps needed for a desired outcome to accomplish the goal. (E). 

-----

K-2.PA.2: Using age-appropriate vocabulary, explain steps taken and choices made to improve the design of a sequence. 

-----

K-2.PA.3: Develop programs with sequences and simple loops to express ideas or address a problem. (E). 

-----

K-2.PA.4: Identify and fix (debug) errors in sequences and simple loops. 

-----

K-2.PA.5: Model daily processes by creating and following algorithms (i.e., sets of step-by-step instructions) to complete tasks. (E). 

-----

K-2.PA.6: Give attribution when using the ideas and creations of others while developing programs. 

## Networking & the Internet (NI)

Learning Outcome: Students explain that information shared over connected computer networks must be protected from unauthorized access. 

-----

K-2.NI.1: Explain what passwords are, why they are used, and why it is important to develop strong passwords to protect devices and information. (E).
