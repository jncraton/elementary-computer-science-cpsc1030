# Early Data Literacy

---

Learning Outcome: Students collect, store,
visualize, and transform data to make
inferences and predictions about the world.

---

K-2.DI.1: Identify and collect data using digital
tools (e.g., take pictures of all blue items, create
a document with things that start with “a”).

## What is Data?

- Information we collect to learn about the world
- It helps us answer questions

## Data for Kids

- For young learners, data is about noticing and counting
- It's about sorting things into groups
- It turns observation into information

How can we make 'data' a friendly, non-intimidating word for a six-year-old?

## Collection

- This is the "gathering" phase
- Digital tools can be cameras, tablets, or computers
- The goal is to capture observations

## A Simple Task

- A student uses a tablet to take pictures of five items in the room
- This is data collection in action

## Storage

- Where do the observations go?
- We need a place to organize our data
- This is where a spreadsheet can come in

## Google Sheets

- Google Sheets is a tool for organizing information
- It uses columns and rows to create a grid
- Think of it as digital graph paper

## Organizing Information

- We can list our collected items in a sheet
- One column for the item's name
- Another column for a description, like its color

## Example Sheet

| Object | Color |
| :--- | :--- |
| Marker | Red |
| Book | Blue |
| Block | Green |
| Rug | Gray |
| Chair | Orange |

## Exercise

Open Google Sheets. Create a new sheet. In column A, list five things you can see. In column B, list their primary color.

What challenges might a first grader face when moving from direct observations to organizing that information in a table?

## Inquiry

- Now we can work with our data
- How many blue things did we find?
