# Modeling Data

---

K-2.DI.2: Define stored information as data and when appropriate, copy, search, retrieve, modify, and delete it

---

K-2.DI.3: Model that data can be stored and manipulated using numbers or symbols to represent information.

---

## What is Data?

- Any piece of stored information
- It can be a number, a word, or a picture

## Data is Everywhere

- The number of students in a class
- The letters in your name
- Your class's favorite colors

## Representing Information

We can represent data using symbols to create a model.

- A number `5` can represent five votes
- A üëç can represent a 'yes' vote

What are some examples of data you could collect from a class on the first day of school?

---

## Storing Data

We need a place to keep our data organized.

- A list on a whiteboard
- A chart on the wall
- A file on a computer

## Digital Storage

Google Sheets is a tool for storing and organizing data in a digital grid.

## Rows and Columns

- Each row can represent a different item or person
- Each column can represent a different category of information

## Exercise

Create a new Google Sheet. Label column A "Pet" and column B "Count". Enter total counts for each pet owned in the classroom.

## Retrieving Data

Retrieving data simply means finding it.

- To find how many votes for dogs, we just look at the cell
- This is searching and retrieving information

## Modifying Data

What if a student changes their mind?

- We can easily change the data
- Just click the cell and type the new information

## Copying Data

Sometimes you need to use the same data in another place.

- You can easily copy and paste information from one cell to another

## Deleting Data

What if we make a mistake or the data is no longer needed?

- We can delete the information from a cell

How might organizing data in a grid help a young student understand information better than just seeing it in a paragraph?

---

## Modeling with Symbols

Let's change our pet survey. Instead of numbers, we can use symbols to represent each student's vote.

- Using a 'D' for Dog, 'C' for Cat, and 'F' for Fish

## Another Example

Let's track a classroom plant's growth.

- Column A: Day
- Column B: Height (cm)
- Column C: Weather (‚òÄÔ∏è or ‚òÅÔ∏è)

## Exercise

In your ice cream sheet, add a third column labeled "Rating". Use a symbol (like a star ‚òÖ or a smiley face üòä) to rate each flavor.

## Data for Kids

How can we adapt this for K-2 students?

- Using pictures or emojis instead of words
- Using simple, relatable datasets like favorite foods
- Focusing on the physical actions of changing the data

## Unplugged First

Before using a computer, model these ideas with physical objects.

- Using sticky notes on a whiteboard
- Moving them around to copy, modify, and delete

Why is it important for children to understand that they can change and correct digital information?

---

## Classroom Application

Have students survey classmates on their favorite season.

- Creating a simple sheet with student names and their choices
- Using emojis to represent the seasons (‚òÄÔ∏è, üçÇ, ‚ùÑÔ∏è, üå∑)

## The "Why"

This teaches that data is not permanent. It's something we create and control to represent information about our world. It's a tool for understanding.

## Exercise

Design a simple data collection activity for a first-grade class. Describe the data to be collected and how you would represent it in a Google Sheet using symbols.
