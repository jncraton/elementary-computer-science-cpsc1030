## What is Computational Thinking?

- Abstraction (problem formulation)
- Automation (solution expression)
- Analysis (solution execution and evaluation)

## Why Teach CS in Elementary School?

- Develops critical thinking
- Enhances problem-solving skills
- Prepares students for future tech-driven world

## Benefits for Future Educators

- Better understanding of technology
- Ability to integrate tech into lessons
- Inspire next generation of innovators

## Example: Decomposition

- Solving a puzzle
- Breaking down a problem into smaller parts
