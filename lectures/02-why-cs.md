## What is Computational Thinking?

- Abstraction (problem formulation)
- Auotmation (solution expression)
- Analysis (solution execution and evaluation)

## Why Teach CS in Elementary School?

- Develops critical thinking
- Enhances problem-solving skills
- Prepares students for future tech-driven world

## Benefits for Future Educators

- Better understanding of technology
- Ability to integrate tech into lessons
- Inspire next generation of innovators

## Example: Decomposition

- Solving a puzzle
- Breaking down a problem into smaller parts

## Example: Pattern Recognition

- Sorting shapes by color and size
- Identifying patterns in data

## Example: Algorithmic Thinking

- Following LEGO instructions
- Step-by-step problem solving

## Exercise: Algorithmic Thinking

- Write a simple algorithm
- Example: Steps to tie shoelaces

## Conclusion

- CS and Computational Thinking are essential
- Empower students to be creators, not just consumers
- Prepare them for a tech-driven future
