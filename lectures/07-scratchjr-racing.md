explain steps taken and choices made to
improve the design of a sequence.

## Describing Challenges

- They need to explain what they tried to do
- They also need to explain why they made those choices

## Explaining Choices

- This helps students think critically
- They can learn from their mistakes
- It also helps them improve their design
