## Beyond the Sequence

- Planning isn't just about a list of steps
- It's also about making choices along the way
- These choices improve the outcome

## What Went Wrong?

- Sometimes the plan doesn't work out
- This is a learning opportunity, not a failure
- We can help children analyze what happened

## A Better Plan

- Talk about what could be changed to improve the plan
- Maybe they need more ingredients or different tools
- This is where the iterative process comes in

What are some age-appropriate words we can use to help children talk about improving their plans?

## The Importance of Words

- Using the right vocabulary is key
- Words like 'sequence,' 'step,' and 'improve'
- Children should be able to explain their thinking

## Explaining Decisions

- Encourage children to explain their choices
- Why did they choose that ingredient or tool?
- This builds their metacognitive skills

## Exercise

Work with a partner. Plan how to tie a shoe and then explain the steps you chose and why you chose them to another pair of students.

How can we help children understand that "failing" at a task is an important part of the learning process?

## Final Step: Review

- After the task is complete, review the process
- Did the plan work as expected?
- What could be done differently next time?
